## Description

This project implements a simple but effective entra phishing protection for your users. It's not bulletproof but can detect simple MITM scenarios by checking the `Referer` header to be a valid microsoft url.
The protection works by using the company branding feature of entra to provide custom css and adding a custom background image. THe background image is served by this webserver and changes based on some parameters.
In a normal login flow, the request to the background image needs to come from `login.microsoftonline.com` which is sent in the referer header (if you still use ADFS the trusted Origins are configurable). In not targeted phishing attacks where an attacker sits in the middle to also bypass the mfa prompt, the referer header will usally be the fake domain. If a non standard domain is detexcted, the background image is changed to a warning image to prevent the user from entering credentials.
Please be aware that this mechanism can easily be bypassed in a targeted campaign so you can implement additional alerts using the provided access logs, like a successful login without an request to this service, or a request from a server ip range. There are also some exposed metrics to include in your dashboards.
The company branding CSS is no fully supported CSS as it's parsed by javascript and you can only [style the predefined elements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/reference-company-branding-css-template). This prevents stuff like including a dynamic CSS so we can only work with the background.
You can also use this project for multiple clients, just create a subdomain for each one and point them to this server. The logs and metrics will include the local servers hostname and can thus be differentiated.

## Example

The following image is shown on a detected phishing attempt. The language of the image is determined using the `Accept-Language` http header sent by the browser. Currently there is only a german and english image provided, all other languages will fall back to english. You can provide your own images using the config file for the various languages you want to support. If you omit the whole image configuration the default images (compiled into the binary) will be used, so there is on need for external ressources.

## CSS to include

Save the following content to `custom.css` and upload it on the `Customer Branding` page in the entra portal.

```css
.ext-sign-in-box {
  background-color: white;
  background-image: url("https://domain.com/image_path");
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

## Configuration

Copy the `config.sample.json`to `config.json` and `Caddyfile.example` to `Caddyfile` and adopt according to your needs.

## CLI Options

Use `--help` to show all available flags and default values
